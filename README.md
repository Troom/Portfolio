# Portfolio

Project are still in development mode. Ultimately, the application will be published and the link will be made available on github.

## What and why i use in this project:


### Backend  
NET7 -> newest C# framework  
CQRS + MediatR -> The most popular application development solution.
OnionArchitecutre -> The most popular application development solution.

### Frontend
React -> Because it's a Library, and it's smaller than Angular. It's super popular  
Typescript -> As C# developer I like strong typed languages.  
MobX -> I need something better to manage state. Better performance, and nice learning curve compared to Redux. And much better than passing props ;)  

### Database  
SQLLite - Easiest way to store data.
